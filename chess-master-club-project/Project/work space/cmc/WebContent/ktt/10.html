<b>Tips for Winning Chess Strategy</b><br>
<i>Always be alert when you play chess</i><br>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Winning Chess Strategy</h1>
<h4>Always be alert when you play chess</h4>
<p>There is a tendency for people play chess to relax once they have reached a good position or to give up hope if their position is very bad when they play chess. These attitudes are natural, but both lead to bad results.</p>
<p>Many players - even chess world champions - when they play chess have achieved winning positions, only to lose because they relaxed too soon. Even the best position won't win by itself; you have to give it some help! In almost any position, the "losing" player will still be able to make threats. The "winning" player has to be alert enough to prevent these positions.</p>
<p>Advice: If you have a better position when you play chess , watch out! One careless move could throw away your hard-won advantage. Even as you're carrying out your winning plans, you must watch out for your opponent's threats.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you have a worse position, don't give up! Keep making strong moves, and try to complicate the position as much as possible. If your opponent slips, when you play chess, you may get the chance to make a comeback. Remember: Where there's life, there's hope.</p>
<p>So be alert all the time when you play chess, no matter what the position is like. A little bit of extra care can pay off in a big way.</p>

<h4>Example L<br>Black to move</h4></div>
<div align="center"><img alt="" src="ktt/567.jpg" border="0" width="338" height="338"></div>
<p>Pretend that you're the general of the Black army in the position shown above. You have, as you can see, an easily won game - since you are four pawns ahead. But White has just moved his Knight to e5. This looks like a silly move, since you could capture this Knight with your own Knight or with your Queen.</p>
<p>But look again. Don't relax because you're winning too easily! If you captured White's Knight with your Knight, what would be his best (and surprising) move?</p>
