<b>Tips for Winning Chess Strategy</b><br>
<i>Think about the endgame when you play chess</i><br>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Winning Chess Strategy</h1>
<h4>Think about the endgame when you play chess</h4>
<p>From the time the game begins, you should remember that every move you make when you play chess may affect your chances in the endgame. For instance, in the earlier parts of the game, a Knight and a Bishop are about equally powerful. Toward the end of the game, though, when there are fewer men in the way, the Bishop can exert its influence in all parts of the board at once, while the Knight still takes a long time to get anywhere. So before you trade a Bishop for a Knight, think not just about the next few moves but also about the endgame.</p>
<p>Pawn structure is crucial in the endgame when you play chess. When you capture one of your opponent's men with a pawn, you'll often create an open file that will help your Rooks and Queen to reach your opponent's side of the board, but you may also get doubled pawns. Since doubled pawns cannot defend each other, they are liability in the endgame. If your opponent survives the middlegame, you may have an uphill fight later.</p>
<p>Concentrate on your immediate plans, when you play chess, as well as your opponent's - but always keep the endgame in mind!</P>

<p>From the very first moves of the game, it's important to have a good pawn formation. How would you assess White's pawn structure in this position?</p><a title="Chess Strategy" href="csa.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Winning Chess Strategy- Answer</span></a>

<p>In the endgame, it's common to see a pawn run to the end of the board and promoted to a Queen. So, pawns are a great thing to hang on to. Study this diagram. Who has the "healthier" pawns, White or Black?</p><a title="Chess Strategy" href="csa.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Winning Chess Strategy- Answer</span></a>
